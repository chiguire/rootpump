## Description

In RootPump, you have an abstract representation of a tree's roots. It's your objective to make it grow as much as possible. The way you do this is by extending the roots one by one. A pulse begins from the stem, and the pulse travels downwards matching the rhythm of a beat you listen to. Depending on how you react to the beat the roots will follow deeper, and you might even see it split into two or more. Avoid the roots touching each other, the pulse will also make everything that goes before bigger.
